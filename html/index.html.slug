  <div class='biggest'>ICANN Hamster</div>
  <div class='big'>An unofficial collection of mostly PDF files downloaded from <a href='https://www.icann.org'>icann.org</a>.
    Currently hosting @@@size-total@@@ Megabytes in @@@files-total@@@ files.<br/><br/>

    <a href='collections.html'>View the Collections</a><br/><br/>
    <a href='/ham'>View the Files</a><br/>
  </div><br/>

  <div class='bigger'>Atom</div>
  An <a href='feed.xml'>Atom feed</a> is updated when new files are added.

  <div class='bigger'>OCR</div>
  Optical character recognition is done with <a href='http://www.tobias-elze.de/pdfsandwich/'>pdfsandwich</a>. PDFs that have been OCR'd end with _ocr.pdf. For example, if document.pdf requires OCR processing a new file called document_ocr.pdf will be created with text. Both files will be kept. We currently have @@@ocr-total@@@ OCR'd files.<br/>

  <div class='bigger'>rsync</div>
  Please do not mass download files over HTTPS. For mirroring please use either sftp or rsync.<br/>

  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync'>rsync</a> is the preferred method for mirroring. icann-pdf runs an rsync server on TCP port 873. No password is required.<br/><br/>

  Test before downloading anything.
  <div class='cli'>rsync -nrtv icann-hamster.nl::ham . </div>

  When you are ready download everything to your current directory.
  <div class='cli'>rsync -rtv icann-hamster.nl::ham . </div>

  Specific directories can be singled out for downloading. Below we only download GAC Communiques.
  <div class='cli'>rsync -rtv icann-hamster.nl::ham/soac/gac/com . </div>

  Specific directories can be excluded from download. Below we tell rsync to not download ICANN Correspondence.
  <div class='cli'>rsync -rtv --exclude="ham/icann/cor/*" icann-hamster.nl::ham .</div>


  <div class='bigger'>sftp</div>
  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol'>sftp</a> is provided for users who wish to mirror over an encrypted connection. ICANN Hamster runs an sftp server on port 22. It's a bit slower than rsync and may require more fiddling to remain up-to-date. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberduck'>Cyberduck</a> is a popular sftp client. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rclone'>Rclone</a> provides archiving over sftp similar to rysnc.<br/><br/>

  <div class='bigger'>Applications / Search</div>
  Having a pile of PDFs is great and all, but how do you find stuff in them? In no particular order, below are some applications that can help with this.
  <ul>
    <li><a href='https://www.houdah.com/houdahSpot/'>Houdah Spot</a></li>
    <li><a href='https://www.zotero.org/'>Zotero</a></li>
    <li><a href='https://gitlab.com/pdfgrep/pdfgrep'>pdfgrep</a></li>
    <li><a href='https://www.google.com/'>Google</a></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Below we use Google to search all SSAC reports for the string "IANA"</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aicann-hamster.nl%2Fham%2Fsoac%2Fssac%2Freports+IANA">
          <div class='cli'>site:icann-hamster.nl/ham/soac/ssac/reports IANA</div>
      </a></li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <div class='bigger'>What's up with hamsters?</div>
  <i>Hamsteren</i> in Dutch means <i>to hoard.</i> It's similar to the English phrase <i>to squirrel away</i>. A Japanese friend of mine told me that <i> to marmot</i> has a similar meaning in Japanese. If you know more examples of languages that use small critters to suggest hoarding please send me a mail and tell me about them.
